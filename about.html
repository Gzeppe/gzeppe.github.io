		My name is Giuseppe, I have been into technology for nearly my whole life. I believe the internet is one of the most important inventions of all time and have always been curious what makes it all work. Early on in middleschool I created flash animations, I had no teachers showing me how to learn this, I had dial up connection and what ever online tutorials there were at the time to learn from. I even got to the point where I created a simple flash game (in middle school) with no help from anyone other then myself. When I was in highschool I was really into art and design I even won the best graphic designer award when I graduated! I spent numerous nights on the weekends just creating art work in photoshop and sometimes I would get so into one particular digital art piece I would be up until the sun came up! Over the years I've learned how to design more professionally in photoshop and code various websites with various technologies (html, css, jquery, bootstrap, etc). My focus currently is becoming an expert in Javascript and getting more involved on the backend side of development. The purpose of this very website is to create something 100% from scratch. I have used numerous javascript libraries in the past and that is great and all as I know how to impliment other developers code for my own purposes but sometimes I'm not always sure exactly how those libraries are functioning line by line. That is why I'm starting from scratch writing everything you see and don't see on this website line by line. This is the journey I am currently on to becoming a well rounded Full-Stack Developer!
